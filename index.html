            <h1>Mary Olowu</h1>
            <h2>Economist, Analyist and Software developer</h2>

            <p> I am a recent graduate with a Barchelors of Science in Economics and Minors in Mathematics and Statistics.
               I am currently exporing software development as a way to 
              produce tangible programs that help solve problems businesses in various industries are facing daily. My goal is to help comapnies
              become more productive by reducing their time and financial cost while increasing output.
            </p>
            <p>There are various processes in business that can either be 
              entirly automated or drastically reduced from its cumversome form.
              My goal is to be a developer who attacks these issues and produces results.
              With my background in Econometrics, mathematics and Statistcs along with my ever growing developer skills, I beleive I can 
              accomplish my good results.
